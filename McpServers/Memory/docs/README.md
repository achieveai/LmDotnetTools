# Memory System Design Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains comprehensive design documentation for a simplified yet sophisticated memory management system inspired by mem0. The design focuses on two primary LLM providers (OpenAI and Anthropic) and Qdrant as the vector storage solution, providing a production-ready architecture with reduced complexity.

## Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Simplicity Through Focus**: Rather than supporting 15+ providers, we focus on proven, reliable solutions that cover the majority of use cases.

**Production-First Architecture**: Every component is designed with production deployment in mind, including error handling, monitoring, performance optimization, and scalability.

**Intelligent Memory Management**: Sophisticated fact extraction and decision-making capabilities that understand context, resolve conflicts, and maintain consistency.

**Modular Design**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces, enabling independent testing, development, and potential future extensions.

**Type Safety and Modern Patterns**: Full type annotations, dependency injection, factory patterns, and async-first design throughout the system.
