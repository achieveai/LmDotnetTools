# Memory Decision Engine - Enhanced with Database Session Pattern

## Overview

The Memory Decision Engine is responsible for intelligently deciding what operations to perform on memories when new facts are extracted. It uses sophisticated LLM-powered logic to determine whether to ADD new memories, UPDATE existing ones, DELETE outdated information, or take no action. Enhanced with Database Session Pattern integration, it ensures reliable resource management and session-scoped decision making.

**ARCHITECTURE ENHANCEMENT**: This design has been updated to integrate with the Database Session Pattern, providing session-aware memory decision operations and reliable resource management for AI-powered memory management.

## Core Components

### 1. MemoryDecisionEngine (Main Class) with Session Support

**Purpose**: Orchestrates the entire decision-making process for memory operations, combining LLM intelligence with analytical logic and session-scoped database operations.

**Core Responsibilities**:
- Analyze relationships between existing memories and new facts within session scope
- Generate sophisticated prompts for LLM-based decision making with session context
- Parse and validate LLM responses for operation instructions
- Apply conflict resolution and quality assurance logic
- Coordinate with memory analyzer and validation components using database sessions
- Ensure session isolation and proper resource cleanup

**Session-Enhanced Interface**:
```csharp
public interface IMemoryDecisionEngine
{
    Task<MemoryOperations> DecideOperationsAsync(
        ISqliteSession session,
        IEnumerable<string> facts,
        MemoryContext sessionContext,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    
    Task<MemoryOperations> DecideOperationsWithExistingAsync(
        ISqliteSession session,
        IEnumerable<string> facts,
        IEnumerable<ExistingMemory> existingMemories,
        MemoryContext sessionContext,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
    
    Task<ConflictResolutionResult> ResolveConflictsAsync(
        ISqliteSession session,
        MemoryOperations operations,
        MemoryContext sessionContext,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default);
}
```

**Decision Process Flow with Session Pattern**:
1. **Session-Scoped Memory Analysis**: Examine existing memories and new facts for relationships within session boundaries
2. **Context Building**: Construct rich context including session information and similarity analysis
3. **LLM Consultation**: Generate sophisticated prompts with session context and obtain structured decisions
4. **Response Validation**: Parse and validate LLM responses for operation feasibility
5. **Session-Aware Conflict Resolution**: Apply advanced logic to resolve conflicting operations within session scope
6. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all operations meet quality and consistency standards with session validation

**Implementation with Session Pattern**:
```csharp
public class MemoryDecisionEngine : IMemoryDecisionEngine
{
    private readonly ILlmProvider _llmProvider;
    private readonly IMemoryRepository _memoryRepository;
    private readonly ILogger<MemoryDecisionEngine> _logger;

    public async Task<MemoryOperations> DecideOperationsAsync(
        ISqliteSession session,
        IEnumerable<string> facts,
        MemoryContext sessionContext,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Get existing memories for session using database session
        var existingMemories = await _memoryRepository.GetMemoriesForSessionAsync(
            session, sessionContext, cancellationToken);

        return await DecideOperationsWithExistingAsync(
            session, facts, existingMemories, sessionContext, cancellationToken);
    }

    public async Task<MemoryOperations> DecideOperationsWithExistingAsync(
        ISqliteSession session,
        IEnumerable<string> facts,
        IEnumerable<ExistingMemory> existingMemories,
        MemoryContext sessionContext,
        CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
    {
        // Create integer mapping for LLM clarity
        var idMapping = CreateIntegerMapping(existingMemories);
        
        // Build session-aware decision prompt
        var prompt = BuildDecisionPrompt(facts, idMapping, sessionContext);
        
        // Get decision from LLM provider with session context
        var operations = await _llmProvider.DecideMemoryOperationsAsync(
            facts, existingMemories, sessionContext, cancellationToken);
        
        // Validate operations within session scope
        var validatedOperations = await ValidateOperationsAsync(
            session, operations, sessionContext, cancellationToken);
        
        // Resolve conflicts with session awareness
        var resolvedOperations = await ResolveConflictsAsync(
            session, validatedOperations, sessionContext, cancellationToken);
        
        _logger.LogDebug("Generated {OperationCount} memory operations for session {UserId}/{AgentId}/{RunId}",
            resolvedOperations.Operations.Count, sessionContext.UserId, sessionContext.AgentId, sessionContext.RunId);
        
        return resolvedOperations;
    }

    private Dictionary<int, int> CreateIntegerMapping(IEnumerable<ExistingMemory> memories)
    {
        // Create simple 1-based mapping for LLM clarity
        var mapping = new Dictionary<int, int>();
        var index = 1;
        
        foreach (var memory in memories)
        {
            mapping[index] = memory.Id;
            index++;
        }
        
        return mapping;
    }

    private string BuildDecisionPrompt(
        IEnumerable<string> facts, 
        Dictionary<int, int> idMapping, 
        MemoryContext sessionContext)
    {
        var existingMemoriesText = string.Join("\n", 
            idMapping.Select(kvp => $"{kvp.Key}. {GetMemoryContent(kvp.Value)}"));

        return $@"
You are a smart memory manager for a session-aware memory system.

Session Context:
- User ID: {sessionContext.UserId ?? "unknown"}
- Agent ID: {sessionContext.AgentId ?? "unknown"}
- Run ID: {sessionContext.RunId ?? "unknown"}

You can perform four operations: (1) ADD, (2) UPDATE, (3) DELETE, and (4) NONE.

New facts to process:
{string.Join("\n", facts.Select((f, i) => $"- {f}"))}

Existing memories for this session:
{existingMemoriesText}

Decide what operations to perform. Use simple numbers (1, 2, 3, etc.) to reference existing memories.
Consider the session context when making decisions - memories should be relevant to this specific user/agent/run.

Return operations in JSON format with integer IDs.";
    }
}
```

### 2. Memory Decision Prompts

**Prompt Engineering Strategy**:
- Sophisticated system prompts with comprehensive decision guidelines
- Rich context integration including existing memories and analytical insights
- Few-shot examples demonstrating complex decision scenarios
- Clear output format specification for structured responses

#### Example: Memory Decision Prompt Template

Based on the actual mem0 implementation, here is the real memory decision prompt used in production:

```
You are a smart memory manager which controls the memory of a system.
You can perform four operations: (1) add into the memory, (2) update the memory, (3) delete from the memory, and (4) no change.

Based on the above four operations, the memory will change.

Compare newly retrieved facts with the existing memory. For each new fact, decide whether to:
- ADD: Add it to the memory as a new element
- UPDATE: Update an existing memory element
- DELETE: Delete an existing memory element
- NONE: Make no change (if the fact is already present or irrelevant)

There are specific guidelines to select which operation to perform:

1. **Add**: If the retrieved facts contain new information not present in the memory, then you have to add it by generating a new ID in the id field.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "User is a software engineer"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Name is John"]
    - New Memory:
        {
            "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "User is a software engineer",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "ADD"
                }
            ]

        }

2. **Update**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory but the information is totally different, then you have to update it. 
If the retrieved fact contains information that conveys the same thing as the elements present in the memory, then you have to keep the fact which has the most information. 
Example (a) -- if the memory contains "User likes to play cricket" and the retrieved fact is "Loves to play cricket with friends", then update the memory with the retrieved facts.
Example (b) -- if the memory contains "Likes cheese pizza" and the retrieved fact is "Loves cheese pizza", then you do not need to update it because they convey the same information.
If the direction is to update the memory, then you have to update it.
Please keep in mind while updating you have to keep the same ID.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "I really like cheese pizza"
            },
            {
                "id" : "1",
                "text" : "User is a software engineer"
            },
            {
                "id" : "2",
                "text" : "User likes to play cricket"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Loves chicken pizza", "Loves to play cricket with friends"]
    - New Memory:
        {
        "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "Loves cheese and chicken pizza",
                    "event" : "UPDATE",
                    "old_memory" : "I really like cheese pizza"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "User is a software engineer",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "2",
                    "text" : "Loves to play cricket with friends",
                    "event" : "UPDATE",
                    "old_memory" : "User likes to play cricket"
                }
            ]
        }


3. **Delete**: If the retrieved facts contain information that contradicts the information present in the memory, then you have to delete it. Or if the direction is to delete the memory, then you have to delete it.
Please note to return the IDs in the output from the input IDs only and do not generate any new ID.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "Name is John"
            },
            {
                "id" : "1",
                "text" : "Loves cheese pizza"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Dislikes cheese pizza"]
    - New Memory:
        {
        "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Loves cheese pizza",
                    "event" : "DELETE"
                }
        ]
        }

4. **No Change**: If the retrieved facts contain information that is already present in the memory, then you do not need to make any changes.
- **Example**:
    - Old Memory:
        [
            {
                "id" : "0",
                "text" : "Name is John"
            },
            {
                "id" : "1",
                "text" : "Loves cheese pizza"
            }
        ]
    - Retrieved facts: ["Name is John"]
    - New Memory:
        {
        "memory" : [
                {
                    "id" : "0",
                    "text" : "Name is John",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                },
                {
                    "id" : "1",
                    "text" : "Loves cheese pizza",
                    "event" : "NONE"
                }
            ]
        }

Below is the current content of my memory which I have collected till now. You have to update it in the following format only:

{existing_memories}

The new retrieved facts are mentioned below. You have to analyze the new retrieved facts and determine whether these facts should be added, updated, or deleted in the memory.

{new_retrieved_facts}

Follow the instruction mentioned below:
- Do not return anything from the custom few shot example prompts provided above.
- If the current memory is empty, then you have to add the new retrieved facts to the memory.
- You should return the updated memory in only JSON format as shown below. The memory key should be the same if no changes are made.
- If there is an addition, generate a new key and add the new memory corresponding to it.
- If there is a deletion, the memory key-value pair should be removed from the memory.
- If there is an update, the ID key should remain the same and only the value needs to be updated.
- DO NOT RETURN ANYTHING ELSE OTHER THAN THE JSON FORMAT.
- DO NOT ADD ANY ADDITIONAL TEXT OR CODEBLOCK IN THE JSON FIELDS WHICH MAKE IT INVALID SUCH AS "\`\`\`json" OR "\`\`\`".

Do not return anything except the JSON format.
```

#### Example: Complex Decision Scenario

Based on the actual mem0 prompt structure, here's how a real decision scenario would work:

**Input:**

**Existing Memories:**
```json
[
    {
        "id": "0",
        "text": "User likes Italian food and pizza"
    },
    {
        "id": "1", 
        "text": "User is planning a trip to Europe next summer"
    },
    {
        "id": "2",
        "text": "User works as a software engineer at TechCorp"
    }
]
```

**New Retrieved Facts:**
```json
[
    "User got promoted to Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp last week",
    "User loves Italian cuisine, especially pasta dishes", 
    "User's Europe trip is confirmed for July 2024, visiting Italy and France",
    "User recently discovered they enjoy Thai food too"
]
```

**Expected LLM Output:**
```json
{
    "memory": [
        {
            "id": "0",
            "text": "User loves Italian cuisine, especially pasta dishes and pizza",
            "event": "UPDATE",
            "old_memory": "User likes Italian food and pizza"
        },
        {
            "id": "1",
            "text": "User's Europe trip is confirmed for July 2024, visiting Italy and France", 
            "event": "UPDATE",
            "old_memory": "User is planning a trip to Europe next summer"
        },
        {
            "id": "2",
            "text": "User works as a Senior Software Engineer at TechCorp (promoted last week)",
            "event": "UPDATE", 
            "old_memory": "User works as a software engineer at TechCorp"
        },
        {
            "id": "3",
            "text": "User enjoys Thai food",
            "event": "ADD"
        }
    ]
}
```

    conflicts = detect_operation_conflicts(operations)
    
    FOR EACH conflict IN conflicts:
        SWITCH conflict.type:
            CASE "duplicate_adds":
                operations = merge_duplicate_adds(operations, conflict)

            CASE "update_delete_conflict":
                // DELETE takes precedence over UPDATE
                operations = prioritize_delete_over_update(operations, conflict)
            
            CASE "logical_inconsistency":

    // Keep DELETE operation, remove conflicting UPDATEs
    filtered_operations = []
    FOR operation IN operations:
        IF operation.event == "UPDATE" AND operation.id == memory_id:
            // Skip conflicting UPDATE
            CONTINUE

- Priority scoring based on category importance

### 4. Conflict Resolver

**Purpose**: Resolves conflicts and inconsistencies in generated memory operations.

**Conflict Types**:
- **Duplicate ADD Operations**: Multiple additions of similar content
- **Conflicting UPDATE Operations**: Multiple updates to the same memory
- **UPDATE/DELETE Conflicts**: Simultaneous update and delete operations
- **Logical Inconsistencies**: Operations that contradict each other

**Resolution Strategies**:
- **Priority-Based Resolution**: DELETE > UPDATE > ADD precedence
- **Merge Operations**: Combine multiple updates into comprehensive changes
- **Temporal Resolution**: Prefer more recent information
- **Quality-Based Selection**: Choose higher-quality operations

**Validation Logic**:
- Operation feasibility checking
- Memory existence validation
- Consistency verification across operations
- Quality threshold enforcement

### 5. Decision Validator

**Purpose**: Ensures all generated operations meet quality standards and business rules.

**Validation Criteria**:
- **Required Field Validation**: Ensure all necessary fields are present
- **Content Quality Validation**: Verify meaningful and substantial content
- **Operation Justification**: Confirm operations are supported by new facts
- **Business Rule Compliance**: Enforce domain-specific constraints

**Quality Filters**:
- Text length and content quality requirements
- Relevance and actionability assessment
- Duplicate detection and elimination
- Format and structure validation

**Error Handling**:
- Invalid operation filtering and logging
- Fallback operation generation for critical failures
- Quality score assignment for monitoring
- Human review triggers for edge cases

### 5. UUID Mapping Strategy

**Purpose**: Prevents LLM hallucinations with UUIDs by mapping real UUIDs to simple integers during processing.

**The Problem**: LLMs often hallucinate or generate invalid UUIDs when asked to reference existing memory IDs, leading to system failures and data corruption.

**The Solution**: Map actual UUIDs to simple integers (0, 1, 2...) when sending to LLM, then map back to real UUIDs when processing responses.

**Implementation Pattern**:
```
FUNCTION create_uuid_mapping(existing_memories):
    temp_uuid_mapping = {}
    processed_memories = []
    
    FOR idx, memory IN enumerate(existing_memories):
        // Map real UUID to simple integer
        temp_uuid_mapping[str(idx)] = memory.id
        
        // Replace UUID with integer in memory sent to LLM
        processed_memory = {
            "id": str(idx),
            "text": memory.text
        }
        processed_memories.append(processed_memory)
    
    RETURN temp_uuid_mapping, processed_memories
END FUNCTION

FUNCTION map_back_to_uuids(llm_operations, temp_uuid_mapping):
    mapped_operations = []
    
    FOR operation IN llm_operations:
        IF operation.event IN ["UPDATE", "DELETE"]:
            // Map integer back to real UUID
            real_uuid = temp_uuid_mapping[operation.id]
            operation.id = real_uuid
        
        mapped_operations.append(operation)
    
    RETURN mapped_operations
END FUNCTION
```

**Benefits**:
- Eliminates UUID hallucination errors
- Ensures LLM can only reference existing memories
- Maintains data integrity and system reliability
- Simplifies LLM reasoning with sequential integers

### 6. Code Block Removal Utility

**Purpose**: Cleans LLM responses by removing code block markers that interfere with JSON parsing.

**The Problem**: LLMs often wrap JSON responses in code blocks (```json ... ```) which breaks JSON parsing.

**Implementation**:
```
FUNCTION remove_code_blocks(content):
    // Pattern matches: ```[optional_language]\n...content...\n```
    pattern = r"^```[a-zA-Z0-9]*\n([\s\S]*?)\n```$"
    match = regex_match(pattern, content.strip())
    
    IF match:
        RETURN match.group(1).strip()
    ELSE:
        RETURN content.strip()
END FUNCTION
```

**Usage in Decision Flow**:
```
// After LLM generates response
raw_response = llm_provider.generate_structured_response(prompt)
cleaned_response = remove_code_blocks(raw_response)
operations = json.parse(cleaned_response)
```
