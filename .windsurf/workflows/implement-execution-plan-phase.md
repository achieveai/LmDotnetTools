# Prompt for LLM Agent: Multi-Phase Implementation with Discovery and Learning

You are tasked with implementing a project broken down into multiple phases, as described in the provided design document, scratchpads, and execution plan. Please follow these instructions:

1. Discovery & Learning First:
  - Before starting any coding or implementation, thoroughly review the design document, scratchpads, and execution plan.
  - Focus on understanding the overall goal and the specific objectives of each phase.
  - Identify any gaps, ambiguities, or areas that require clarification.
2. Scratchpad for Learnings:
  - As you learn and discover new information, capture all key findings, insights, and decisions in the scratchpad.
  - Update the scratchpad continuously throughout the process to document your evolving understanding and rationale.
3. Goal Confirmation:
  - Do not begin implementation until you have confirmed your understanding of the projectâ€™s main goal.
4. Summarize your understanding of the goal and wait for confirmation or correction before proceeding.
  - Question-Driven Clarification:
  - If you encounter any ambiguous or unclear areas, ask the user (me) for clarification.
  - Ask one question at a time, and wait for a response before proceeding to the next question.
5. Phase-by-Phase Execution:
  - Once the goal is confirmed and ambiguities are resolved, proceed to implement the **given** project phase as outlined in the execution plan.
  - At the start of each phase, review relevant materials and update the scratchpad with your plan and any new discoveries.
6. Continuous Learning:
  - Continue to capture learnings and update the scratchpad as you progress through each phase.
  - If new ambiguities arise, repeat the question-driven clarification process.
  - Use sequential-thinking to constantly orgaize throughts.
7. Completion:
  - Upon completing each phase, summarize what was accomplished, what was learned, and any remaining open questions.
