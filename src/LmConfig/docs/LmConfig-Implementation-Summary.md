services.AddLmConfig("models.json");

// Get unified agent
var agent = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IAgent>();

// Automatic provider resolution
var response = await agent.GenerateReplyAsync(messages, new GenerateReplyOptions 
{ 
    ModelId = "gpt-4.1-mini" // System automatically finds best provider
});

// Cost-optimized selection
var costOptimizedOptions = new GenerateReplyOptions
{
    ModelId = "claude-3-sonnet",
    ExtraProperties = new Dictionary<string, object?>
    {
        ["preferred_tags"] = new[] { "cost-effective", "economical" },
        ["prefer_lower_cost"] = true
    }.ToImmutableDictionary()
};
