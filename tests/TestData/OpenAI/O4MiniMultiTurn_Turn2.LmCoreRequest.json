Compare digit by digit from left to right:\n   \u2013 The \u201C9\u201D before the decimal point is the same in both.  \n   \u2013 In the tenths place:  \n     \u2022 9.90 has a 9 in the tenths place  \n     \u2022 9.11 has a 1 in the tenths place  \n     Since 9 \u003E 1, 9.90 (i.e. 9.9) is larger than 9.11.\n\nAlternatively, multiply both by 100 to eliminate the decimal:\n\n   \u2022 9.11 \u00D7 100 = 911  \n   \u2022 9.9 \u00D7 100  = 990  \n\nAnd 990 \u003E 911, so 9.9 \u003E 9.11.",
